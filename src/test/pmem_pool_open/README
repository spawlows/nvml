This is src/test/pmem_pool_open/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem{trn,blk,log}_pool_open().

The program in pmem_pool_open.c takes a list of files with a pool type
prefix on them.  For example:

	./pmem_pool_open t:file1 b:file2 l:file3

will call pmemobj_pool_open() on file1, pmemblk_pool_open() on file2, and
pmemlog_pool_open() on file3.

The first 4k of the file is captured before and after the open calls
are done, and the program reports if the first 4k changed.  This can
be used to determine if a new memory pool was created (so the header
was generated and the program reports a change), or an existing pool
was found (so the header was left alone and the program reports no
change).

Finally, the program then tried to dereference the opaque pool handle
and prints a message is a SEGV signal results (which it should).

By passing the same file multiple times, more interesting scenarios
can be tested.  For example:

	./pmem_pool_open t:file1 t:file1 b:file1

can be used to test that the first argument causes a new pool to be
created, the second argument causes an existing pool to be found, and
the third argument causes EINVAL due to opening a pmemobj pool with
pmemblk_pool_open().
